# Hey, I'm Maxime 👋

Full-stack developer building at the intersection of blockchain and traditional web. I'm based in France and work remotely with teams worldwide.

I ship products—from DeFi protocols to dev tooling to whatever problem needs solving. Currently splitting time between open-source work, personal and client projects.

## What I'm Working On

🖼️ **[RenderFast](https://renderfa.st)** — Dynamic image generation API for e-commerce, real estate, og images and much more. One template, thousands of product variations. URL API makes it dead simple to integrate.

🔧 **[shadcn-dioxus](https://github.com/MBeliou/shadcn-dioxus)** — Porting shadcn/ui components to Dioxus (Rust). Because the Rust UI ecosystem deserves nice things.

🔗 **[aptos-wallet-adapter-svelte](https://github.com/MBeliou/aptos-wallet-adapter-svelte)** — Svelte wallet adapter for Aptos. The most beloved framework on the web need an adapter too.

📊 **[Convergence](https://github.com/MBeliou/passive-liquidity-aptos)** — Intelligent concentrated liquidity management for Aptos DEXes, one place to check up on liquidity and money markets. Hackathon winner. [Learn More](https://dorahacks.io/buidl/34023)
